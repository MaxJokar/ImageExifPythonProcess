Geospatial representation drone camera coordinates with Python ,ExIF , Folium 


If you have a set of drone imagery and you want to know the location and direction of the camera,
We have done an applied example that retrieves the geospatial metadata .from the drone camera for a group
of images and makes a geostapatial repretacion on a map with the image name 
available as popup. These codes are  done under a Jupyter notebook with image EXIF metadata using Python .
